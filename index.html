                <li>Once website is hosted, I can give you a FREE 10 minute tutorial on how to change simple text like store hours, headers, paragraphs, etc. This way you don't need to hire me or anyone else to change simple text. 
                    <b>A simple mistake could mess up the whole website if you're not careful!</b></li>
                    <li>Once website is hosted, I have completed my part of the deal.</li>
                    <li>If your website goes down for any reason, you will need to contact your web host, as it has nothing to do with the computer programmer/designer.</li>
                    <li>If you require any assistance after our deal is completed, depending on how time consuming the task is, there will be a small fee.</li>
